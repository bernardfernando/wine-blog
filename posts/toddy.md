# Toddy - Palm wine

Country of origin: Worldwide
Palm wine, known by several local names, is an alcoholic beverage created from the sap of various species of palm tree such as the palmyra, date palms, and coconut palms. It is known by various names in different regions and is common in various parts of Africa, the Caribbean, South America, South Asia, Southeast Asia and Micronesia.
\
\
The sap is collected from the cut flower of the palm tree by a [tapper](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/132C8/production/_106263587_mediaitem106263586.jpg.webp) - health & safety?. A container(a clay-pot) is fastened to the flower stump to collect the sap. The white liquid that initially collects tends to be very sweet and non-alcoholic before it is fermented.
\
\
Palm sap begins fermenting immediately, due to natural yeasts in the air (often spurred by residual yeast left in the collecting container). Within two hours, fermentation yields an aromatic wine of up to 4% alcohol, mildly intoxicating and sweet. The wine may be allowed to ferment longer, up to a day, to yield a stronger, more sour and acidic taste, which some people prefer. Longer fermentation produces vinegar instead of stronger wine.
