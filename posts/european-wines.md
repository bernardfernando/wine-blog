The first wines I ever tried were European, most of the wines I buy are still European and I’ve visited more European vineyards than those on any other continent. Except that I don’t think of them as “European”, but as French, Italian, Spanish, Greek … The great fallacy of the whole wretched Brexit debate is that individual countries lose their identity from being part of Europe. Well, not when it comes to wine, they don’t – or very little else, for that matter.
